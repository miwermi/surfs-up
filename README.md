After years of loving to catch waves in North Carolina, attending surf camp in Costa Rica for a week, and just returning from an awesome trip to Hawaii, I'm ready to go all-in on my dream surf life and relocate to Hawaii forever!  I just need a business to run.  I've developed a wicked awesome business plan for a surf and shake shop... and I've found an excellent investor candidate. He's been burned before when a shop he invested in opened in a spot with too much rainy weather. It's a good point and I'm happy to do a detailed weather analysis before I invest all my savings too!
